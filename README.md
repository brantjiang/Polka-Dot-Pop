# Polka-Dot-Pop
A little game written in Java

Goal: 
1) Clear all polka dots from the screen by clicking on them
2) Use as little clicks as possible (don't miss!)

Rules:
1) Polka dots will explode into smaller dots when clicked
2) After a certain point, polka dots will disappear when clicked
3) There are three game modes: Baby, Normal, and Nightmare <br>
   a) Game mode dictates: <br>
      i)   How many polka dots spawn <br> 
      ii)  How many times polka dots explode <br>
      iii) How fast polka dots move <br>

Below is a quick demo: <br>

2) The recording software distorted window sizes
