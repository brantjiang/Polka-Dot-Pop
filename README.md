# Polka-Dot-Pop
A little game written in Java

Goal: 
1) Clear all polka dots from the screen by clicking on them
2) Use as little clicks as possible (don't miss!)

Rules:
1) Polka dots will explode into smaller dots when clicked
2) After a certain point, polka dots will disappear when clicked
3) There are three game modes: Baby, Normal, and Nightmare
   Game mode dictates: 
      i)   How many polka dots spawn 
      ii)  How many times polka dots explode
      iii) How fast polka dots move

Below is a quick demo:

Notes:
1) The recording software distorted the cursor size & location
2) The recording software distorted window sizes
